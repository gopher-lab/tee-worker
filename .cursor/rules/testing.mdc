## Testing Rule

**Before writing any test code:**

1. **Create a Test Plan**: Always develop a clear, detailed plan that outlines:
   - What tests will be written
   - Which files will be modified or created
   - The approach and methodology
   - Expected outcomes and impacts

2. **Prefer Ginkgo & Gomega**: When writing tests, use the Ginkgo and Gomega frameworks (BDD style) where possible to structure and assert tests in Go. Only use the built-in `testing` package for compatibility or legacy reasons, or if instructed.
